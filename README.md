# Calculate PI with multithreads and MPIR Library

This is my practice project.<br/>
This program calculate the PI value according to the number of digits entered by the user.<br/>
And default use 8 threads to do parallel calculate.

The algorithm uses [Gauss Legendre Algorithm].<br/>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_algorithm

Library uses MPIR(Multiple Precision Integers and Rationals).<br/>
